				<br><h2>Smartcities</h2>
				<br> <h3>The Smart cities or intelligent cities, they are the result of the need increasingly imperious 
				<br> of orientating our life towards the sustainability. This way, these cities are served infrastructures,
				<br> innovation and technology to diminish the energetic consumption and to reduce the CO2 emissions.
				<br> </h3><h2>Of what do these measures consist towards the sustainability?</h2>
				<br><h3> To be served photovoltaic panels in the communities,
				<br> more means of transport and electrical vehicles, wind mills in lampposts, solar panels for semaphores or signs, 
				<br>promotion and development of the use of bicycles … The Smart Cities uses variety of resources, and all these small 
				<br>acts lead to a city to turning in more efficient and sustainable.<br><br>
				<br></h3><h2>What cities are the most intelligent of the world? </h2>
				<br><h3>There are different parameters for those who are valued more to a 
				<br>city that different. For it they are considered to be 10 dimensions that are key: Governance, town planning, public 
				<br> management, technology, environment, international projection, social cohesion, mobility and transport, the human 
				<br>capital and economy. Bearing in mind that the perfect city does not exist, it is necessary to walk towards this 
				<br> perfection with all the means to the scope. For example, Tokyo or New York, they should improve his aspect of 
				<br>social cohesion. They have to take advantage of the technologies of the information and the communications to improve,
				<br> simultaneously that is kept a commitment with the environmental environment. 
				<br>For 2050, according to the OECD, if drastic measurements are not taken the economic and demographic growth will have 
				<br> an environmental and social impact without precedents. Bearing in mind that the majority of the population will center 
				<br> in the big cities, it becomes indispensable to overcome the challenge of more than 2.000 million additional inhabitants for 2050.
